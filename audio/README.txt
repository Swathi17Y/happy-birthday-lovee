🎧 DROP YOUR VOICE NOTE HERE
=============================

Add your recorded voice/song file with EXACTLY this filename:

  voice_note.mp3

Any of these formats also work — rename to match:
  voice_note.mp3
  voice_note.m4a
  voice_note.ogg
  voice_note.wav

After adding the file, open the game → play through Level 1 →
click the 🎧 play button to hear your voice note play! 💕

If no file is found, the button just looks pretty 🌸
